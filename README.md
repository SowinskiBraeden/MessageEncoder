# Message Encoder

This project came to me as just an Idea.
Using the current time of the supposed message sent. It uses the numbers of time (In 24 hour format) to encode each letter of a message individually.
I have also made a minified version for javascript that exports the functions for either later use, or for you to use in a small side project.
